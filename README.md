## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive Python implementation of a Blackjack game, designed as an educational tool to enhance understanding and application of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Here are key highlights of the project:

### Gameplay Dynamics
The game involves two main players: the Dealer, controlled by the computer, and the Player, controlled by the user. It starts with a standard deck of 52 cards, spanning four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, each suit containing cards numbered 1 through 13.

### Initial Setup
Upon starting, the Dealer shuffles the deck to ensure randomness and deals two cards each to the Player and itself. The Player can see both of their cards but only one of the Dealer's cards, adding a strategic layer to the game.

### Player Options
The Player aims to get as close to 21 points without going over. To achieve this, they can "Hit" to receive additional cards or "Stand" to end their turn, balancing the risk of busting (exceeding 21) against the chance of getting closer to 21.

### Winning Conditions
A unique aspect of Blackjack is the possibility of winning with a 'Blackjack', which occurs if the Player's initial hand equals 21. This differs from assembling 21 points over several turns. The game concludes when the Player stands, revealing both hands to determine the winner.

### Educational Focus
Emphasizing OOP, this project requires students to apply concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and method overloading. It serves as a practical application of theoretical knowledge, promoting deeper understanding through the creation of a functional game.

### Collaboration through Pair Programming
A distinctive educational strategy employed in this project is pair programming. This involves two students collaborating closely; one codes while the other offers guidance and suggestions. This method not only enhances learning outcomes by involving students actively in the coding process but also fosters soft skills such as communication and teamwork.

This detailed approach not only solidifies programming skills but also encourages students to engage in collaborative problem-solving, reflecting real-world software development practices.
